A project dedicated to analyzing KCMO weather vs. crimes committed.  The project takes a look at rain, temperature, snow, and other adverse conditions and compares it to a variety of crime as well as time of day the crimes were committed.  Data sources are the KCPD and Historical Hourly Weather Data from Kaggle.
